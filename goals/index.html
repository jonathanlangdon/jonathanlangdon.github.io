                  While making this portfolio I was surprised in how much it
                  seems that I have already learned, and yet when I look ahead
                  there is still so much more to delve into.

                  In the
                  <a href="../training/"> Developer Training section</a> of this
                  portfolio, I cover in the various learning tools what I
                  continue to plan to pursue. I was going to also cover that
                  here, but that would be a violation of the DRY principle as
                  updates to my learning would need to be updated in two places.

                  I have thoroughly enjoyed learning a number of programming
                  languages including python, javascript, C# and SQL and feel
                  that the logic and software design clicks in my brain. After
                  working in the industry for a year or two, I would like to
                  continue my education some day and get a Masters in computer
                  science.

                  I am open to a number of different avenues to take my career
                  with the primary interest being in a career using python, C#
                  or Javascript.

                  I want to continue to grow in being a better husband, father
                  and man in general. I want to live a balanced life that has a
                  place for work, but isn't dominated by just one domain of
                  life.

                  Even though working in a school has been rewarding and I have
                  grown a lot, I'm ready a different adventure. Here are some
                  personal things I'd like to pursue in the next 10 years:
                  hiking, camping, reading books, swimming, running, regular
                  board gaming, ultimate frisbee and more vacations with the
                  family.
