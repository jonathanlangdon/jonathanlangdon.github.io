                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  When I was in high school I dabbled in some HTML and PHP
                  websites for fun, but it was just a hobby and I didn't pursue
                  it any more seriously at the time.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  Then over the next years I used a number of CMS's to manage
                  websites - whether for personal purposes or on behalf of
                  others. Websites that I've used to create/maintain websites:
                  <a href="https://mrlangdon.wixsite.com/portfolio">Wix</a>,
                  <a href="https://langdonscience.weebly.com/">Weebly</a>,
                  WordPress,
                  <a href="https://www.hulingsandassociates.com">Squarespace</a
                  >, Google Sites and Blogger.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  The biggest website that I maintained was on behalf of our
                  school for a number of years. During that time I made 2 major
                  overhauls of the school website trying to make it more
                  responsive and modern. For the first one, I used a simple
                  HTML/CSS template and for the second design I used WordPress
                  (but even then I still got into the code directly to make some
                  specific tweaks that weren't possible in the GUI).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  Besides maintaining our
                  <a href="https://www.calvaryeagles.org">school's website</a>,
                  I also have an active client that I maintain a business
                  website for:
                  <a href="https://www.hulingsandassociates.com"
                    >Hulings & Associates</a
                  >
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I'm familiar with some basic domain management - whether
                  updating CNAME's, setting up SSL certificates or deploying
                  simple server-side applications. At our school I'm our Google
                  Admin for our domain and have touched most parts of that
                  interface. While I can't claim to have deep knowledge in many
                  of those areas, I've dabbled enough in many different realms
                  to at least be able to figure things out and make things work.

                  In 2024 I decided to formalize the developer training I had
                  been working on by pursuing a degree in Software Engineering.
                  In 3 months I completed 16 courses from Sophia.org and
                  Study.com allowing me to transfer into Western Governor's
                  University(WGU) with 60% of the degree already complete since
                  I already had a bachelor of science in Chemistry. In the first
                  two months with WGU, I completed 11 courses allowing me to
                  rapidly complete my Software Engineering degree.

                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  After graduating from Calvin University, I have worked at
                  Calvary Christian Schools in Fruitport, MI until present. I
                  started as a high school science teacher, but after a while my
                  role started shifting into more technical roles. I started
                  helping create the class schedules (one big puzzle that I
                  always enjoyed putting together), helping with the school
                  technology that just came naturally to me, and even took over
                  some building maintenance. Those roles grew over time (with
                  the technology part taking up the majority of the job) and
                  eventually I let go of all the classes I was teaching to move
                  into the administrative and support staff roles I took on.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I grew a lot and gained a variety of experiences while
                  learning a wide range of things: from networking, work in the
                  terminal, SSH, security camera systems, chromebook management,
                  library management software, student information systems, HVAC
                  software and even fixing a broken sprinkler system that half a
                  dozen other people couldn't fix.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I've learned a lot of determination and flexibility in
                  troubleshooting problems and finding solutions. As an example
                  of creative problem solving, there was one period we were very
                  limited on budget but in great need to update our computers.
                  We got computers donated to us from Baker College but didn't
                  have extra funds to buy the licenses for operating systems and
                  software. I spent a lot of time researching Linux and learning
                  how to deploy a fleet of computers using open source software
                  to save the school tens of thousands of dollars. From student
                  computers to teacher computers, we used Linux for many years
                  (up until recently when we got chromebooks for students and
                  iMacs for staff thanks to covid funding).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I also had some side jobs over the years: driver's ed
                  instructor, technology coordinator for soundboard/livestream
                  volunteers at our church, track and field head coach, board
                  game club advisor and also got a masters in Educational
                  Technology from Michigan State University.

                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  In some of my free time, I also worked on creativity skills
                  with some YouTube videos making
