                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  When I was in high school I dabbled in some HTML and PHP
                  websites for fun, but it was just a hobby and I didn't pursue
                  it any more seriously at the time.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  Then over the next 20 years I used a number of CMS's to manage
                  websites - whether for personal purposes or on behalf of
                  others. Websites that I've used to create/maintain websites:
                  <a
                    href="https://mrlangdon.wixsite.com/portfolio"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Wix</a
                  >,
                  <a href="https://langdonscience.weebly.com/" target="_blank"
                    >Weebly</a
                  >, WordPress,
                  <a href="https://www.hulingsandassociates.com" target="_blank"
                    >Squarespace</a
                  >, Google Sites and Blogger.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  The biggest website that I maintained was on behalf of our
                  school from 2012-2019. During that time I made 2 major
                  overhauls of the school website trying to make it more
                  responsive and modern. For the first one, I used a simple
                  HTML/CSS template and for the second design I used WordPress
                  (but even then I still got into the code directly to make some
                  specific tweaks that weren't possible in the GUI).

                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I no longer maintain our

                    >school's website</a

                  business website for:

                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I'm familiar with some basic domain management - whether
                  updating CNAME's, setting up SSL certificates or deploying
                  simple server-side applications. At our school I'm our Google
                  Admin for our domain and have touched most parts of that
                  interface. While I can't claim to have deep knowledge in many
                  of those areas, I've dabbled enough in many different realms
                  to at least be able to figure things out and make things work.

                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  After graduating from Calvin University in 2008, I have worked
                  at Calvary Christian Schools in Fruitport, MI until present. I
                  started as a high school science teacher, but after 4 years my
                  role started shifting into more technical roles. I started helping create the
                  class schedules (one big puzzle that I always enjoyed putting
                  together), helping with the school technology that just came
                  naturally to me, and even took over some building maintenance.
                  Those roles grew over time (with the technology part taking up
                  the majority of the job) and in 2022 I let go of all the
                  classes I was teaching to move into the administrative and
                  support staff roles I took on.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I grew a lot over those years - gaining a variety of
                  experiences and learning a wide range of things: from
                  networking, work in the terminal, SSH, security camera
                  systems, chromebook management, library management software,
                  student information systems, HVAC software and even fixing a
                  broken sprinkler system that half a dozen other people
                  couldn't fix.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I've learned a lot of determination and flexibility in
                  troubleshooting problems and finding solutions. As an example
                  of creative problem solving, in 2013 we were very limited on
                  budget but in great need to update our computers. We got
                  computers donated to us from Baker College but didn't have
                  extra funds to buy the licenses for operating systems and
                  software. I spent a lot of time researching Linux and learning
                  how to deploy a fleet of computers using open source software
                  to save the school tens of thousands of dollars. From student
                  computers to teacher computers, we used Linux for 10 years (up
                  until recently when we got chromebooks for students and iMacs
                  for staff thanks to covid funding).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-center">
                  I also had some side jobs over the years: driver's ed
                  instructor for 7 years, technology coordinator for
                  soundboard/livestream volunteers at our church and also got a
                  masters in Educational Technology from Michigan State
                  University in 2015.
