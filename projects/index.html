                  This was a fun project that I did for a friend who works for a
                  local company in Muskegon. They were going to a trade show and
                  had the idea of creating a custom video game that was themed
                  around their company.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  I jumped at the opportunity to practice my newly formed
                  programming skills and found some starter code on GitHub that
                  I could mold into shape for my friend's user story.

                  After about 25 hours of work, the forked python game now
                  included the following additional features that the starter

                  It was a successful fork of a fun game to add some additional
                  features. It was one of my first projects in coding and it
                  wasn't the cleanest code I've written - if I were working on
                  it now, I would try to refactor it for the functions and
                  classes to be smaller and remove some duplicated code. But
                  since it was a once and done project for a single trade-show,
                  I didn't need to code to be perfect for maintainability.

                Another fun thing I've done over the past 8 years is to collect
                data on what factors influence whether or not we have snow days
                in our local district. I created a snow day calculator in an
                Excel spreadsheet that correctly fit the data from the past 8
                years with a 90% accuracy, and was eager to make a website that
                would share that calculation with others.

                One thing I thought would be cool to incorporate into the
                application would be the integration of a weather API that pulls
                in the forecasted data and any weather alerts. Weather.gov's API
                proved to be an excellent candidate.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Another factor in developing this project was creating a Node.js
                application on the server to keep the calculation formula
                private. Keeping the calculation on the server side protects the
                intellectual property of the snow day calculator so that someone
                else can't easily pirate the site.

                In future revisions I hope to add a feature that allows you to
                grab the user's device location and get the GPS coordinates that
                way to make it one step easier for users. I would also like to
                add advertisements to the site to help pay for the server costs.
                A third improvement would be loading animations for users to
                know whether the API fetching is taking a long time or just
                broken.

                memorization app that is styled similar to Duolingo. In this

              </p>
              <ul>

                This app has the potential of being far more than what it

                demonstration of the project, I just converted the database (I
